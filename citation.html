            <p> Shadow Deflect is a pixel-puzzle game that was created in a team of two for Community Game Jam held on August 2019. To be able to clear the stages, the player eliminates the enemy by shooting a bullet and to be able to hit the enemy the player needs to deflect the bullet with walls and pillars in the stages.
                The theme for the game given by the jam was "the game is a liar". Both I and my teammate brainstorm ideas about how we want the game to be as well as come up with innovations for the game. Both of us have experienced in creating pixel designs so we agreed to make it a pixel game. There were so many choices from our list of ideas and we had a hard time choosing one that is interesting and can be developed well using our current knowledge in programming.
