            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Casteria is a pixel-shooter game that was made in a one man-team project for the course Digital Games: Genre, Structure, Programming and Play's final project in Fall 2018 term. The story involves a witch who is trapped inside a dungeon filled with monsters. She encounters different kind of monsters along the way as she tries to escape the dungeon. The objective of this game is for the player to clear all stages by getting rid of the enemies that are trying to harm the player. This project was made using the processing software.

            <div class="images-container-parent">
              <div class="images-container-child">
                  <img src="images/cast3.webp" alt="casteria figure 3"/>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p> Since the project was quite open-ended, there were no constraints in terms of creativity and designs of the game as long as it meets the coding requirements needed in the program. There were 2 ideas that got my utmost attention after I brainstormed them.
            </p>
            <p>The first row of sketches (figure 1 and 2) is about a jumping game, where the player controls a character that jumps continuously and uses arrow keys to move the character. I was not able to escalate the difficulties on the levels that much as it lacks features that can be implemented in the game. </p>
            <p> The second row is Casteria (figure 3 and 4), the final game I decided to do for the final project. It came up with two varieties, with one being a turn-based strategy game and the other variation being a pixel shooter game.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="proj-child">
          <h1>Process</h1>
          <div class="images-container-parent">
            <div class="images-container-child">
                <img src="images/cast5.webp" alt="casteria figure 5"/>
            </div>
            <div class="images-container-child">
                <img src="images/cast6.webp" alt="casteria figure 6"/>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>As can be seen in figure 5, Originally I wanted to make the game a turn-based strategy genre where the player can both attack and defend depending on the situation with the enemies. This became the first challenge I had when designing the game. In the prototype, the game mechanic itself is fully implemented, however I was not completely satisfied with how the game turned out (shown in figure 6) as it lacks gameplay and the overall look of the game is bland. </p>
          <div class="images-container-parent">
            <div class="images-container-child">
                <img src="images/cast7.webp" alt="casteria figure 7"/>
            </div>
            <div class="images-container-child">
                <img src="images/cast8.webp" alt="casteria figure 8"/>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Then from the turn-based genre, I developed it into the pixel shooter game (displayed in figure 7,8, and 9), where the player can move freely and avoid incoming attacks from the enemies. It looks more dynamic in general and is more sustainable in terms of survivability as the player can pick up power-ups spawned randomly across the map.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="proj-child">
          <h1>Reflection & result</h1>
          <p>Based on this game alone, I realized there are many different possibilities that can be created with coding. I was able to make two distinct games while trying to find the right genre for the game. If I were given the chance, I could have definitely done better with the animation and enemy behavior as they did not meet my expectation. I would also add more features to the game to make it more challenging and fun to the game. Overall, the final grade received for the course was B+.
